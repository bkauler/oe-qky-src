wget in pyro, at meta/recipes-extended, is version 1.19.1
unfortunately, this breaks some scripts, as it no longer logs
to standard error, instead to ~/wget-log*

This causes a problem in scripts that do "wget .... 2>&1 | .... "
coz they won't get the log info piped through.

have rolled back to 1.17.1, from krogoth.
