09-rox-filer-easy-home.patch
is hardcoded with path /mnt/wkg/home
to suit Easy Linux.

TODO:
Improvement to this patch, to work on all pups, maybe have
file /etc/working-path, instead of this in main.c:

const char *easy_home_dir="/mnt/wkg/home";

replace it with code to read /etc/working-path, or if
that file not exist or empty, default to "~"
