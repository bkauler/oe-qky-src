------------
first attempt compiling for target i586, everything built except rox-filer
built a 64-bit executable.

fixed by editing files/oe-precreate-makefile.patch:
commented out the "CC = gcc", as this prevented OE from using its cross-compiler.
changed "CFLAGS =" and "LDFLAGS =" to "CFLAGS +=" and "LDFLAGS +="
