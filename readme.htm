            <h1>OE-Quirky</h1>
            The <i>oe-qky-src</i> folder contains a snapshot of
            OpenEmbedded and a "layer" for building a complete set of
            binary packages for creating Quirky Linux or Puppy Linux (or Easy Linux or other Puppy-derivative).<br>
<br>
Please note that the Quirky/Puppy distribution is not (yet) created in OpenEmbedded. The reality so far is that OE-Quirky "only"
            creates binary packages that must then be used in Woof* to
            build the Quirky/Puppy distribution.<br>
            <br>Woof-CE is the current build system for creating a
            Puppy distro from binary packages, and woofQ is the current
            build system for Quirky (and Easy). Currently only woofQ has
 '0pre-oe', a script for importing binary packages from the OE build.<br>
            <h2>Why?</h2>
            Although woof* builds a distro from any binary packages, 
Barry has always been keen on having control of the entire cycle, from 
source code to final distribution.<br>
Using an existing binary repository, such as Debian, Ubuntu or 
Slackware, has enormous advantages, not least being binary compatibility
 with that repository -- and the Puppy Package Manager (PPM) is able to 
install any packages from that repository.<br>
<br>
However, there are downsides, such as unwanted dependencies, bloat, and being forced into certain architectural structures. <br>
<br>
Barry built some earlier versions of Puppy compiled entirely from source, using the T2 Project. This includes <i>Wary</i> and <i>Racy</i> Puppy -- back in 2013, but still very popular choices for people with older PCs. Then again, after forking to Quirky, <i>April</i> in 2015.<br>
<br>
Having total control of the entire cycle means that very
            specific distros can be created. The main thing in
            comparison with Debian and Ubuntu will be a great reduction
            in bloat. In other words, Quirky/Puppy will be very small
            and fast.<br>
            <br>
            Barry is currently focusing on building a distro for surfing
            the Internet. Good web browser, multimedia player, printing.<br>
            <br>
            Another reply as to "why?" is that this is a very cool thing
            to do. Anyone with basic Linux skills should be able to
            download oe-qky-src and run a couple of simple commands and
            build an entire distro themselves ...then add and remove
            packages to create their own custom distro.<br>
            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            You must be running a x86_64 host Linux system, and have
            expanded the oe-qky-src folder in a partition with Linux
            filesystem (preferably ext4) and at least 150GB free space.
            The PC must have at least 2GB RAM and there must be a swap
            partition.<br>
            <br>
            The host Linux system used by the developer Barry Kauler is
            Quirky x86_64, version 8.1.6 (or later). This is built from Ubuntu
            16.04 Xenial Xerus DEB packages, and as-is requires just a few
            tweaks to work with OpenEmbedded.<br>
            <br>
            For Quirky 8.1.6, it is required to install <i>python3</i>
            and <i>ca-certificates</i> from the Puppy Package Manager
            (PPM).<br>
            <br>
            To use <i>Toaster</i>, which is a GUI interface available
            in OE, it is also required to install <i>python3-django</i>,
            <i>python3-pip</i> and <i>python-beautifulsoup</i>.<br>
            <br>
Not to forget the full development environment, gcc, headers and the 
rest, which is, in the case of Quirky 8.1.6, a single PET package named <i>devx-8.1.6-xerus64.pet</i>.<br>
<br>
            Itemizing, install these, as well as their dependencies:<br>
            <i>devx, ca-certificates</i>, <i>python3</i>, <i>python3-django</i>,
            <i>python3-pip</i>, <i>python-beautifulsoup</i> <br>
            <br>
            Puppy Linux x86_64 distributions should be OK also, in particular
            those based on Debian/Ubuntu DEBs (for example XenialPup).<br>
<br>
A couple more things to check in the host distro: <br>
<br>
OE expects the executable 'python2' and 'python3', so you might have to 
create symlinks. For example, "ln -s python3.5 /usr/bin/python3" and "ln
 -s python2.7 /usr/bin/python2"<br>
<br>
The 'ca-certificates' package should have installed lots of certificates
 in /etc/ssl/certs. If not, run "/usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates"<br>
            <h2> Getting started</h2>
            In a Linux partition with at least 150GB free space, create
            a top-level folder with an appropriate name, for example
            "oe", then download 'oe-qky-src' from github.<br>
<br>
The download can be done in a few different ways. If you have 'git' 
installed, with a terminal open inside the 'oe' folder, run this:<br>
<pre># git clone https://github.com/bkauler/oe-qky-src.git oe-qky-src</pre>
Or, if you don't have 'ca-certificates' installed (meaning that the above won't work), then this will work:<br>
<pre># git clone git://github.com/bkauler/oe-qky-src.git oe-qky-src</pre>
<br>
To either of the above, you can append "--depth 1" if you don't want the history -- and the download is smaller.<br>
<br>
Or, you can download a zip file. Go to the github page in your browser 
and click on the "Download" button, then choose "Download zip". This 
will download 'oe-qky-src-master.zip' -- download into the "oe" folder.<br>
<br>
oe-qky-src site: <a href="https://github.com/bkauler/oe-qky-src">https://github.com/bkauler/oe-qky-src</a><br>
<br>
In Puppy and derivatives, you can right-click on the zip file and choose
 "Open with...", then "Xarchive" or "PupZip" to extract the files. They 
will extract to folder "oe-qky-src-master" -- rename that to just 
"oe-qky-src".<br>
<br>
OK, now to using it...<br>
<pre># cd oe-qky-src<br># ./create-oe-qky</pre>Up-one level, you will see newly-created folders "downloads" and "oe-quirky". Folder "oe-quirky" has everything, and you can get setup to do a build:<br><pre># cd ../oe-quirky<br># source oe-init-build-env buildPC</pre>Folder "buildPC" is building for a PC, x86_64 CPU. Alternatives are "buildPC32" for a PC with i686 32-bit CPU, and "buildPi" is for a Raspberry Pi2 and Pi3.<br><br>A quick sanity test is to check that the layers are found:<br><pre># bitbake-layers show-layers</pre>To do the actual build, you must have an Internet connection, a reasonably fast one -- if using wi-fi provided by a telco, 4G is strongly recommended over 3G.<br>Also, a fast PC with plenty of RAM is required. Although OE state a minimum of 2GB RAM with swap partition, at least 4GB is recommended.<br><br>Note that the Internet connection must be maintained throughout the build, as some packages, such as libreoffice, download extra source packages during compile.<br>In otherwords, you cannot download all source packages prior to commencing the build.<br><br>An annoyance is that libreoffice does not preserve the downloads globally for other builds. So, everytime that libreoffice gets compiled, it has to download lots of extra packages.<br><br>Off we go, for the next few hours (or days, depending on your PC):<br><pre># bitbake core-image-quirky</pre>Barry's main PC for doing OE builds has a i5-4200 3.10GHz CPU, 16GB RAM and 1TB hard drive, and a build takes about 9 hours.<br><br>Before or after the build, you can run this command to obtain lists of all chosen packages and their dependencies:<br><pre># bitbake -g core-image-quirky</pre>...you will then see files "pn-buildlist", "task-depends.dot" and "recipe-depends.dot" in the "buildPC" folder.<br><br>If you intend to export the packages to woofQ, the Quirky Linux build system, the above command is essential, as the files it produces are read by the packages-import script in woofQ.<br><br>At the end of the build in OE, you will see many warning messages about incorrect packaging. These do not matter, as the export to woofQ does not use the OE packaging stage -- instead, the 'image' folder in each package build (which has the result of 'do_install') is read by woofQ and woofQ does its own packaging.<br><br>Also, if for any reason the final step, 'do_rootfs', fails in OE, that does not matter, as woofQ builds its own rootfs.<br><br><h2>Deploy</h2>coming soon<br><br><h2>About Quirky Linux</h2>Quirky and Easy, originally forks of Puppy Linux, inherit the very small size yet with just about every package that you will need, as well as simplicity and power-to-the-user.<br><br>To achieve the small size, careful choices are made of which packages and dependencies to use. It is useful to note what is <i>not</i> in Quirky:<br><br><blockquote><font color="#ff0000">avahi esound gtk+3 </font><font color="#ff0000"><font color="#ff0000">jack </font>multilib </font><font color="#ff0000"><font color="#ff0000">pulseaudio </font>qt systemd</font> <br></blockquote><br>...at least, these exclusions are for the build in OE. Some puppies have gtk+3 and qt. They may also inherit multilib and dependencies of whatever distribution is used as the source of binary packages. But <i>none</i> of them have pulseaudio or systemd! (Puppy manages to castrate these if binary packages depend on them).<br><br>Future builds in OE may include gtk+3 or qt apps, however for now all gui apps in Quirky are gtk+2 or x11 based. Note, there are various reasons for not using gtk+3.<br><br>Many major applications, such as Firefox, SeaMonkey and LibreOffice, build with gtk+2. In some cases, for example Evince, where gtk+2 has been abandoned, an older version is used, with patches to keep it "up to date".<br><br>Another important factor is that there is a very prolific Puppy developer community, and there are hundreds of GUI applications specifically created for Puppy, most of them using gtk+2.<br>Thus, we have no difficulty with populating a distro with an extensive suite of GUI utilities and applications with only gtk+2 and x11 available.<br>
        <br>
        About Quirky itself, what is it?<br>Quirky Linux was forked from Puppy Linux when Barry retired from maintaining the latter. Quirky is Barry's plaything, to experiment with new ideas. Consequently, there have been major architectural changes with different releases of Quirky. The recent offshoot Easy Linux, is another experimental architecture.<br><br><br><h2>Links</h2>Puppy related:<br><ul><li>Woof-CE: <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=101174">http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=101174</a> <br></li><li>Forum: <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/">http://murga-linux.com/puppy/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li>Home site: <a href="http://puppylinux.com/">http://puppylinux.com/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li></ul>Quirky related:<br><ul><li>Quirky x86_64 8.1.6: <a href="http://bkhome.org/news/201701/quirky-816-x8664-released.html">http://bkhome.org/news/201701/quirky-816-x8664-released.html</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li>Quirky x86_64 8.3: <a href="http://bkhome.org/news/201707/quirky-xerus64-83-final.html">http://bkhome.org/news/201707/quirky-xerus64-83-final.html</a> <br></li><li>Easy: <a href="http://bkhome.org/easy/">http://bkhome.org/easy/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li><br></li></ul>To find out more about what Barry is doing, read his blog:<br><a href="http://bkhome.org/news">http://bkhome.org/news</a> <br>
